# Java ArithmeticException: Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates a common error in Java: the `ArithmeticException` that occurs when dividing by zero.  The `bug.java` file contains the faulty code, while `bugSolution.java` provides a corrected version.

The bug is simple: an integer division where the divisor could be zero.  The solution adds a check to prevent this scenario.  Understanding and handling division-by-zero errors is crucial for robust Java programs.
